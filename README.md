[EXPERIMENTAL] A quick kotlin program to transform a Behringer BCR2000 to a full NRPN control surface.

It is not really meant to be usable. I just use it to set my BCR2000 as a full NRPN surface (all the preset, store learn etc are set as controllers).

It may turn in something more interesting one day (but probably never, don't expect anything).
